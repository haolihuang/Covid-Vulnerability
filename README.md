# What factors correlate to countries vulnerable to Covid-19?

2021 Boston Regional Datathon by Citadel.

I organized my thought process, the code, and the conclusions of the modeling in a Jupyter notebook, which can also be viewed as an html file.

## Introduction
Over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, it became clear that some countries are hit harder than others, but why? It may be surprising to some that the countries suffer the most are mostly the wealthy western countries that should have adequate resources to react to the virus. We wanted to identify important factors which vulnerable countries share in common. The insights gained from this analyses could be a valuable information to have to better prepare for a possible future pandemic.

## Overview
We were given time series data of Covid-19 statistics, along with inherent factors of each country. To evaluate the severity of of Covid-19 in each country, I decided to use `total_death_per_million` on the 300th day after the first case was reported in the country as the dependent variable. In other words, the data was no longer time series because we took a snapshot of it. I then discarded all time-dependent features and focused only on the inherent factors.

I also included external data scrapped from Wikipedia and other websites. The external data were cleaned and merged to the given data. The external data I explored are as follows.
- Democracy index: People in democratic countries may react differently to lockdown restrictions than those in less democratic countries. In addition, democratic countries might spend more time to settle on a policy and/or might not enforce the policies as strictly.
- International tourism (arrival/departure): Movement of people makes virus spread more easily.
- Country geography (island/Schengen/others): This may indicate how effectively border control can be imposed.
- Gender of leader: Brought up by the NY Times. Female leader may indicate a progressive country, diverse cabinet, and potentially more robust decision making.
- Obesity rate: This is reported to be an important risk factor for severe Covid-19 cases.

I chose to build a linear regression model, which is relatively easy to explain, using the `statsmodels` package to fit the data. When building the model, I adressed the skewed distribution and multicollinearity of some features, and I checked the feature linearity and outliers to make sure we ended up with a robust model.

Lastly, I performed variable selection to select predictors that are associated with the dependent variable and fit the model using only those variables. This way, we could also determine which fators were the important ones that really correlated with the severity of Covid-19. I tried both forward and backward selection, which yielded similar results.

## Takeaways
In this analysis, we combined the given dataset with external datasets scraped from Wikipedia and used these features to build a linear regression model to fit the total Covid-related deaths per million population of countries on the 300th day after the first case was reported. We found that the location (continent), geography (island or not), gender of leader, population density, age structure, obesity rate, GDP per capita, and hospital beds per thousand are important factors that explains the Covid deaths.

Some factors give us insight on how to better deal with the pandemic if one ever hits again. `geography` suggests a more stringent border control likely works well, and `hospital_beds_per_thousand` suggests that we should always have the capacity to react for a sudden surge of patients to minimize preventable deaths. `leader` suggests the importance of a diverse cabinet to robust decision making.

Other factors are inherent and not changeable, such as `continent`, `population_density`, `median_age`, `obesity_rate`, and `gdp_per_capita`. Still, it would be important for countries to recognize if they are more vulnerable to a pandemic according to these factors identified by our model. If so, they should invest resources accordingly to tackle the situation.

Due to the time constraint, availability of the data, and the complex nature of this problem, we are not able to dig deeper into how exactly each feature impact on the total deaths number, but we do have some educated guesses as explained above. We think it would be a good direction to go into for future studies.
